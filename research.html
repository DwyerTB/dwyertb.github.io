				<strong> Natural Language Processing </strong> </br>
I came to Penn interested mainly in Natural Language Processing, and began working with <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/">Dr. Chris Callison-Burch</a> my freshman year. I collaborated with Minh Nguyen to develop <a href="https://github.com/paynesa/multimodal"> multimodal word embeddings </a> in spring 2019. In summer 2019, I was funded by the <a href="https://www.curf.upenn.edu/content/penn-undergraduate-research-mentoring-program-purm"> Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program (PURM) </a> to continue this project. However, we quickly realized that we struggled to come up with embeddings for anything that was not a single word, and so my project developed into one on <a href="https://github.com/paynesa/SemanticCompositionality"> semantic compositionality </a>. I worked with several amazing people in the summer of 2019, including <a href="https://www.curf.upenn.edu/project/shi-run-sherry-training-language-vision-mapping-contextualized-bert-embeddings-construct">Sherry Shi</a>, who was also funded by PURM. You can find an article on this project <a href="https://www.curf.upenn.edu/project/payne-sarahcognitively-motivated-models-semantic-compositionality"> here </a>. 
In fall 2019, I continued work on a related area, namely the ability to map adjectives to visual transformations on images, similarly to how <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D10-1115/">adjectives can be represented as matrices</a> for written words. This work is ongoing. </br></br>
<strong> Computational Phonology </strong></br>
As I became increasingly interested in the computational and cognitive underpinnings of language acquisition, I began working with <a href= "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~swingley/">Dr. Daniel Swingley</a> on the development of phonological embeddings that can be used in models of language acquisition. We aim to use bottleneck features to extract embeddings based on a wide variety of linguistic input that can be used to model a newborn baby's phonological perception. This work is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/">Dr. Emmanuel Dupoux</a> and <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/people/person/thomas-schatz/">Dr. Thomas Schatz </a>. In January 2020, I was funded by <a href="https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/"> MindCORE </a> to travel to the <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/"> University of Maryland </a> to work with Dr. Schatz and <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/index.html">Dr. Naomi Feldman </a> to further develop this project. This project is still in progress, with the goal of in-person collaboration with Dr. Dupoux in the near future.</br></br>
<strong> Computational Morphology and Cognitive Approaches </strong></br>
I originally became interested in the relationship between human language processing and computational language tools while studying with <a href="https://live-sas-www-ling.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/yang"> Dr. Charles Yang</a>. While taking his class, I conducted a study with my roommate's Seeing Eye Dog (thanks Kay and Zenith!) about evidence against fast-mapping in dogs. I later presented the results of this study and the <a href="https://lx.berkeley.edu/news/slugs-symposium-2019"> Berkeley SLUgS Linguistics Symposium </a>. In spring 2020, I began working with Dr. Yang and <a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jkodner/">Dr. Jordan Kodner</a> on computational morphology. Namely, we wish to derive a cognitively-motivated computational model of morphological acquisition. In summer 2020, I will be working at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</a> on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGsIKHKqKdw&feature=youtu.be">ADAM project</a> with Dr. Yang, <a href="https://www.isi.edu/people/gabbard/about">Dr. Ryan Gabbard</a>, and others.

					<h2>Research Statement</h2>
			</header>
				<p align="left">
					Much of current Natural Language Processing uses machine learning techniques over large and highly-saturated
					datasets, which poses a stark contrast to the relatively small, sparse data to which children are exposed.
					Yet humans are far more linguistically adept than any NLP software that currently exists.
					If we are able to extract and employ the algorithms put to use by the human language faculty, then we will be able to create
					language technology that behaves much more like a human. Further, this will allow us to vastly reduce the amount of data upon
					which we train compared to current NLP models, which will be especially useful for low-resource languages. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational linguistics and psycholinguistics,
					with a particular interest in computational complexity. I see the relationship between these areas of study as bidirectional
					and mutually beneficial: we may employ cognitive methodology to inform the design of NLP tools, but we may also employ computational
					tools to learn more about the human language faculty.

					<strong>DARPA GAILA Project</strong> </br>
					I am currently a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.isi.edu/">Information Sciences Institute</a>
					working on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGsIKHKqKdw&feature=youtu.be">ADAM project</a>,
					ISI's effort for DARPA's <a href="https://intelligencecommunitynews.com/darpa-seeks-proposals-for-gaila-program/">
					Grounded Artificial Intelligence Language Acquisition (GAILA)
				</a> program. Our goal is to demonstrate success in language acquisition from cognitively-plausible perception-language
					pairings; my work specifically focuses on implementation of the program in Chinese and the ablation of various
					perceptual cues. This program is a collaboration with
					<a href="https://www.isi.edu/people/gabbard/about">Dr. Ryan Gabbard</a>, <a href="https://www.isi.edu/people/mrf/about">Dr. Marjorie Freedman</a>,
					<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~mitch/">Dr. Mitch Marcus</a>, <a href="https://live-sas-www-ling.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/yang">
					Dr. Charles Yang</a>, and others. The <a href="https://github.com/isi-vista/adam">ADAM code</a> is open-sourced with the goal of providing a "sandbox" for future
					researchers in this area.</br></br>


					<strong> Computational Morphology</strong></br>
I originally became interested in the relationship between human language processing and computational language tools
					while studying with <a href="https://live-sas-www-ling.pantheon.sas.upenn.edu/people/yang">
					Dr. Charles Yang</a>. In spring 2020, I began working with Dr. Yang and
					<a href="https://www.ling.upenn.edu/~jkodner/">Dr. Jordan Kodner</a> on computational morphological
					segmentation and generation. Namely, we wish to derive a cognitively-motivated computational model
					of morphological acquisition that can be applied to NLP tasks and demonstrate that this model can succeed on sparse input
					like that which a child might experience.</br></br>

					<strong> Computational Phonology </strong></br>
As I became increasingly interested in the computational and cognitive underpinnings of language acquisition,
					I began working with <a href= "https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~swingley/">Dr. Daniel Swingley</a>
					on the development of phonological embeddings that can be used for the modelling of concepts in phonological learning
					such as categorical perception. We aim to use bottleneck features to extract embeddings based on a
					wide variety of linguistic input that can be used to model a newborn baby's phonological perception.
					This work is a collaboration with <a href="http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/">Dr. Emmanuel Dupoux</a>
					and <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/people/person/thomas-schatz/">Dr. Thomas Schatz </a>.
					In January 2020, I was funded by <a href="https://mindcore.sas.upenn.edu/"> MindCORE </a> to travel to
					the <a href="http://ling.umd.edu/"> University of Maryland </a> to work with Dr. Schatz and
					<a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/index.html">Dr. Naomi Feldman </a> to further develop this project.
					This project is still in progress, with the goal of in-person collaboration with Dr. Dupoux in the near future.</br></br>

				<strong> Multi-modal Approaches and Compositionality</strong> </br>
I came to Penn interested mainly in Natural Language Processing, and began working with
					<a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/">Dr. Chris Callison-Burch</a> my freshman year. I collaborated with
					Minh Nguyen to develop <a href="https://github.com/paynesa/multimodal"> multimodal word embeddings </a> in spring 2019.
					In summer 2019, I was funded by the
					<a href="https://www.curf.upenn.edu/content/penn-undergraduate-research-mentoring-program-purm">
						Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program (PURM) </a> to continue this project. However, we quickly
					realized that we struggled to come up with embeddings for anything that was not a single word, and so my project
					developed into one on <a href="https://github.com/paynesa/SemanticCompositionality"> semantic compositionality </a>.
					I worked with several amazing people in the summer of 2019, including
					<a href="https://www.curf.upenn.edu/project/shi-run-sherry-training-language-vision-mapping-contextualized-bert-embeddings-construct">
						Sherry Shi</a>, who was also funded by PURM; you can find an article on this project
					<a href="https://www.curf.upenn.edu/project/payne-sarahcognitively-motivated-models-semantic-compositionality"> here </a>.
					In fall 2019, I continued work on a related area, namely the ability to map adjectives to visual transformations on images,
					similarly to how <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D10-1115/">adjectives can be represented as matrices</a>
					for written words. The code for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/paynesa/SemanticCompositionality">here</a>.
